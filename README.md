## Getting started

First install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now you should be able to start the app:

```bash
npm run app
```

When working on the node part of the project, it's easier to have the app restart when changes to the source are made:

```bash
npm run local
```

Now when you make changes to the node source files, node will restart automatically.
